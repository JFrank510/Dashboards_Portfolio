# Excel Dashboard: Data Cleaning and Visualization
This dashboard showcases my skills in data cleaning and visualization using Microsoft Excel. In this project, I cleaned and transformed a dataset containing customer information, including their marital status, gender, commute distance, age, education, region, and income.

## Data Cleaning
To prepare the data for visualization, I performed the following data cleaning steps:

1. Removed duplicate rows
2. Standardized the values in the Marital Status column, replacing 'S' with 'Single' and 'M' with 'Married'
3. Standardized the values in the Gender column, replacing 'F' with 'Female' and 'M' with 'Male'
4. Standardized the values in the Commute Distance column, replacing '10+' with 'More than 10'
5. Created a new column called Age Brackets, using an IF statement to classify customers as teenagers, middle-aged, or elderly.

## Data Visualization
To visualize the cleaned data, I created three pivot tables and three charts:

- A chart showing the average income per purchase by customer
- A chart showing the distribution of customers by age brackets
- A chart showing the distribution of customers by commute distance

To make the dashboard more interactive, I added three slicers allowing users to filter the data by marital status, region, and education. All the charts and pivot tables on the dashboard are linked to these slicers, allowing users to see how the data changes based on their selections.

Overall, this Excel dashboard demonstrates my ability to clean and transform data, and to create visually appealing and informative charts and pivot tables using Microsoft Excel.
