# Data Visualization Dashboard with Power BI
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize financial data of a company. The data used for this project was obtained from an Excel file downloaded from Kaggle, which contains detailed information about the company's revenues and expenses for the period 2020-2022. The main objective of the dashboard is to provide a clear and concise visual representation of the data without performing complex transformations.

## Data Used
The data was obtained from the following Excel file downloaded from Kaggle: [Data_PowerBI.xlsx]. The file includes the following fields:

- Country: the country where the company operates.
- Brand: the brand associated with the revenues and expenses.
- Customer: the name of the customer or company associated with the transactions.
- Revenues: the revenues generated by each transaction.
- Expenses: the expenses associated with each transaction.
- The data was used as-is without additional transformations to focus on visualization and analysis.

## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard offers the following features and visualizations:

- General Summary Page: Provides an overview of key data, such as the total number of records, summarized statistics of revenues and expenses, and other relevant indicators.
- Interactive Revenues and Expenses Chart: Includes a combination of a bar chart and a line chart to visualize the evolution of revenues and expenses over time. It allows users to explore the data from different perspectives and levels of detail.
- Filters and Slicers: Implemented filters and slicers enable users to select and filter the data based on their specific needs. Users can filter by country, brand, or other relevant attributes, enabling personalized analysis.
